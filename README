Simple file renderer. Put files in the "base" directory, run skinator.py e voilá: the files will be copied in the outputs directory.

Of course it doesn't just "copy" files. It'll check the variables declared in the config/base_config.ini, get the base files and creates a copy of them in the ouputs directory with the placeholders replaced. To make it work, put placeholders in the base files in this format {{name_of_declared_variable_in_config}}

For further information, check the config/base_config.ini. It controlls the variables and the name of the output directory.
